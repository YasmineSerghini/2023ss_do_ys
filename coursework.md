## Buffer

At a company like Buffer, all salaries have been transparent since 2013. Compensation is a transparent internal discussion, where the whole Buffer team can share thoughts and feedback.

A lot has changed in their salary formula over the past few years. They took a very simple formula and made it more accurate to the labor market. Most recently, they’ve been focused on improving the formula to make it a true benchmark for a remote-first world.
