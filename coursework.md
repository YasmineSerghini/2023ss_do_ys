### The Lean Salary Framework

- Officially introduced with the salary round in summer 2016
- Since then, it has undergone several major revisions

---

### The Goals

#### Never negotiate salaries again

Compensation at sipgate is market-based, not based on individual negotiating skills. Therefore, there are no individual salary negotiations. However, everyone receives their individual salary. Those who perform similar work are paid similarly, but individual experience and company tenure also count. Compensation is automatically calculated each year using a simple formula based on the same objective criteria.

---

#### The overall package is clearly above average

The believe: the overall package must be right. Money is just one component and should always be roughly at the level that someone in the market would receive for their position and corresponding professional experience. It is the extras that make the overall package clearly above average.

---

#### A salary increase every year. For everyone.

No one has to change companies just to make a salary jump. Sipgate wants everyone to make a career with them and continuously improve every year. Therefore, everyone at sipgate should receive a salary increase every year.

---

### The model

Our salary model is based on criteria defined by us for fair pay at sipgate. We have put these criteria into a formula. It is the ideal tool for us to determine current salaries for everyone. Working with our formula forces us to treat everyone equally and saves us time through standardization and automation.
We work on our criteria annually to continually improve our salary model. Therefore, the formula changes every year. Our salary models carry version numbers with the year to make their limited validity clear. The current salary model 2022 is valid until December 31, 2022.
