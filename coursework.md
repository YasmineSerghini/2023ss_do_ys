## Who?

## Buffer

Buffer is a super cool website that helps people manage their social media.
But what's even cooler is their pay system - everyone knows how much everyone else makes!

The whole team gets together to talk about pay and give their thoughts.

---

Buffer's salary formula is like a math equation:

<p align="center">

JOB

EXPERIENCE

LOCATION

</p></br>

Each of these things gets a number, and we add them together to get your salary.
This way, everyone who has similar skills and experience gets paid similarly.

|       Basic       |      Benefits      |
| :---------------: | :----------------: |

### The Lean Salary Framework

</br>

The model was officially introduced with the salary round in summer 2016. Since then, it has undergone several major revisions.

---

![Goals](Goals.png)

---

### The model

<p align="left">
Set of criteria
</p>
<p align="right">
Ensure fair pay
</p></br>
<p align="center">
Formulated into a tool
</p></br>
<p align="left">
Treat everyone equally
</p></br>
<p align="right">
Standardization and automation
</p>

---

To **continually improve** the salary model, the company reviews the criteria annually, and updates the formula accordingly. Each year, **a new version number** is assigned to the model to reflect its limited validity.

</br>

For example, the current salary model 2022 will remain valid until December 31, 2022.

---

### Components

![Components](Components.png)

---

### Disadvantage of the model

</br>

A disadvantage of a formula in general is that it tempts one to make assumptions about its future dynamics. It looks as if the formula already predicts what everyone will earn in five or ten years from now.

---

### Fails

Higher salary for developers with informatics diploma (other educational paths seemed inferior)

</br>

Didn't consider personal educational paths (unequal pay for colleagues in the same job)

</br>

No communication that the salary formula wasn't appropriate for predicting future salaries

<small>Sipgate corrected these mistakes in later versions of their salary model.</small>

---

### Feedback

Overall, positively received when introduced in 2016

</br>

|             Positive             |                   Criticism                    |
| :------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
| Understanding salary composition |      Introduction isn´t complete project       |
|             Fairness             |                Ongoing process                 |
|    Automatic annual increase     | Explaining, defending, continuously developing |

---

### Comparison

Buffer

- formulaic approach
- considers factors like job function and location

Sipgate

- determines Role Factors
- extensive research on typical starting salaries

</br>

Both companies offer competitive compensation packages, but Sipgate sweetens the deal with a fixed amount (Role Fixum). Their employee-centric cultures and commitment to fair pay set a high bar for compensation practices in the modern workplace.
